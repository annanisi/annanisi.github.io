## Field instruction

### Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program

-   The [DDCSP program](https://conservationscholars.ucsc.edu/) is a field-based leadership program designed to improve justice and equity in conservation.

-   As a visiting instructor during summer 2022, I developed and implemented field-based instruction on ecological field project design, statistics and writing, and professional development programming for two weeks of the summer field quarter.

-   I was also a DDCSP grad mentor for the entire summer field quarter in 2021.

### Small Mammal Undergraduate Research in Forests (SMURF)

-   I coordinated the [SMURF program](https://undergradresearch.ucsc.edu/ugr/small-mammal-undergraduate-research-in-the-forest-smurf/) from 2018-2020, which collected long-term small mammal monitoring data at two UC reserves. In this role I organized and ran twice-quarterly field trips and provided field instruction on animal capture and handling.

### UCSC Supercourse

-   I was a TA for the [UCSC Supercourse](https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/academics/undergrad/field-experience/field-experience-quarters.html), an intensive field quarter that included a 3-week field period. This involved supervising and advising student field projects, teaching fieldwork and presentation skills, and managing field safety and logistical concerns.
