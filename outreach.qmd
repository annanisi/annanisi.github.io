I love interacting with the public about my research and broader questions related to ecology and conservation. I have given a numerous outreach talks over the years to a variety of audiences, from K-12 schools to senior living facilities to groups of managers and stakeholders. Below, I have highlighted a few examples of outreach writing, speaking, and leadership roles.

## Popular Science Writing

I wrote a companion [popular science piece](https://theconversation.com/new-maps-show-high-risk-zones-for-whale-ship-collisions-vessel-speed-limits-and-rerouting-can-reduce-the-toll-242267?notice=Article+has+been+updated) in *The Conversation* (November 21 2024) associated with my [global analysis of whale ship-strike risk](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1950). I wanted to explain our study clearly for a broad audience, and add more background information than is possible to do in a scientific publication. This piece has been republished by 16 additional news outlets, including including [*Popular Science*](https://www.popsci.com/environment/new-maps-show-high-risk-zones-for-whale-ship-collisions/)*,* [*Seattle Post-Intelligencer*](https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/new-maps-show-high-risk-zones-for-whale-ship-19934851.php), [*SFGate*](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/new-maps-show-high-risk-zones-for-whale-ship-19934851.php), and [*Yahoo News*](https://nz.news.yahoo.com/maps-show-high-risk-zones-190951908.html).

## Radio interview with Think Out Loud - Oregon Public Broadcasting

I gave a [radio interview](https://play.cdnstream1.com/s/opb/think-out-loud/university-of-washington-ca813f) on *Think Out Loud* discussing my [global analysis of whale ship-strike risk](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1950). (As a side note, I happened to be on the same episode as the incredible [Pattiegonia](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/12/10/in-bend-and-beyond-drag-queen-pattie-gonia-advocates-for-inclusivity-and-diversity-in-the-outdoors/)!)

## Santa Cruz Puma Project

As a PhD student at UCSC, I was a capture supervisor on the [Santa Cruz Puma Project](https://www.santacruzpumas.org/). Our fieldwork capturing and tracking pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains brought us into regular contact with landowners, including navigating the aftermath of human-wildlife conflict events, and we regularly assisted the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to capture and translocate pumas that entered into urban areas. During my time with SCPP I gave regular outreach talks on puma natural history and conservation to a wide variety of audiences.

## Society for Conservation Biology - Santa Cruz Chapter

Roles: President (2019-2021), Secretary (2017-2019)

During my PhD, I led the Santa Cruz Chapter of the Society for Conservation Biology alongside some wonderful friends and colleagues. We put on a series of seminars related to local conservation issues, hosted a successful fundraiser for a community-based conservation organization, and organized the 2021 Bay Area Conservation Biology Symposium.
