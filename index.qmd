![](null)My name is Anna Nisi (she/they), and I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels at the University of Washington. I aim to understand how large, highly mobile predators coexist with people in human-dominated landscapes and seascapes and apply that information to develop conservation solutions.Â My research spans marine and terrestrial systems. For my postdoc at the University of Washington, I am modeling great whale distributions in order to map ship-strike risk across the world's oceans, at both global and regional sclaes. During my PhD at UC Santa Cruz, I studied how habitat fragmentation impacts puma (*Puma concolor*) movement ecology and population dynamics
