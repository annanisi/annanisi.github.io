My name is Anna Nisi and I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Center for Ecosystem Sentinels](https://ecosystemsentinels.org/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.biology.washington.edu/). I aim to understand how large, highly mobile predators coexist with people in human-dominated landscapes and seascapes and apply that information to develop conservation solutions.Â My research spans marine and terrestrial systems. For my postdoc at the University of Washington, I am modeling great whale distributions in order to map ship-strike risk across the world's oceans, at both global and regional scales. During my PhD at UC Santa Cruz, I studied how habitat fragmentation impacts puma (*Puma concolor*) movement ecology and population dynamics.
